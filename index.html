      <p>Mesh WiFi is a whole home WiFi system built to eliminate dead zones and to provide uninterrupted WiFi throughout your home.

        Mesh routers enable devices in your network to have faster speeds, greater coverage, and a more reliable connection. While traditional routers broadcast WiFi from a single point, mesh WiFi systems have multiple access points.</p>

      <p>You can now enjoy a movie theater experience wherever and whenever you want, thanks to Samsung.

        The South Korean electronic giant’s latest projector is an ultra-compact device that looks more like a can of soup than a source for big-screen movie experiences. And while the projector may be small in size, it promises to be just as capable as its larger and more stationary peers.</p>

            <h2>Apple announces new Fitness Plus features for users</h2>
            <p> <b> American tech giant</b> Apple has recently announced a couple of new features to its Fitness Plus subscription service.

              As per GSM Arena, the new features aim at making the users morning run more pleasurable.</p>

          <h2>Huawei’s Google Maps Alternative Updated with Must-Have Navigation Features</h2>
          <p> <b>Back in May 2019, Huawei ended up being banned from using products (including software, services, and hardware) from American companies.</b> Called Petal Maps, the app is already available on Huawei devices and can also be installed by anyone out there with an Android smartphone.

            The latest update to version 2.1.0.306 brings a lot of important features to Petal Maps, including support for offline maps. As you probably know already, offline maps are also available in Google Maps, but without a doubt, they’re an excellent addition to Huawei’s feature arsenal.
            
            The offline maps allow users to get navigation directions even with an Internet connection, as long as the data is already downloaded on the device.
            
            In addition, this new update also includes lane guidance, a feature that’s also available in the majority of navigation apps out there, as well as so-called virtual navigation to make it possible for users to explore their route options in advance.</p>

          <h2>Apple GPS Tracker Thwarts New-Generation Truck Double Theft Attempt</h2>
          <p> <b>At its core, the Apple AirTag is a device built with a very clear goal in mind: help owners keep track of their belongings and never lose stuff like keys and wallets anymore</b>

           On the other hand, it was just a matter of time until criminals out there discovered a different side of the AirTag, eventually using the device for things like stalking and keeping track of potential theft targets.

             The number of people complaining they’re being tracked by strangers has skyrocketed lately, but as it turns out, the AirTag can sometimes really come in handy. And not only when it comes down to finding your lost keys</p>
