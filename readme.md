# Welcome to CSS and SASS assignment

Please copy your HTML from the ac11y lesson to here
and add some styling to it using Flex-box or Grid.
PS: keep your styling simple and don't spend too much time figuring out what colors, fonts etc

Instructions:

1. Install project dependency: `npm install`. Make sure in the terminal, you are inside the project folder

2. Run this in your terminal: npm run sass:watch
   now you can add styling in style.scss and it will compile it automatically to style.css
